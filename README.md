# Community-Empowerment-Visualization
With a vision to connect people who want to develop Haiti together, this visualization project aims at bringing together organizations who want to create sustainable projects in Haiti.

The visualization would provide support for development in Haiti by educating potential volunteers and patrons about country's developmental priorities, and facilitate direct fund-raising.
